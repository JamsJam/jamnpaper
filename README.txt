# respon-paper

 I'll try here to make my firs responsiv website. <br/>
I challenge me to buid a 4 page website w/ HTML/CSS. <br/>
The four pages are :
- index.html --> the Home page
- index1.html --> the "all product" page
- index2.html --> the product page
- index3.html --> the contact page
    
There is a CSS file but I don't know yet how to deal w/ the four pages style. w/ one, or two CSS file ? or maybe w/ the @import rule ?

I still learning and that's why I began that project.
